# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
#Define Software Engineering:
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

software engineering is a systematic of designing, coding, deployment and maintenance of software product.

difference between software engineeering and tradinal programming is that?
software engineeering focvus on all software development life cycle and 
traditionnal programming only focus on coding.#


#Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

software development life cycle consist of 6 stage>
requirement that deals with gathering of information from the user/customer on what kind of software he/she need
designing most deals with designing software architecure based on UI and UX.
developing deals with typing and creating the product
testing if the product do what it was supposed to do.
deployment giving product to customer
maintenance deals with updating,repairing and debugging of the software product#


#Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

waterfall methodology use and depend on following SDLC form the first stage to the last.
while agile do not follow SDLC mechanism programmer can stat with any stage of SDLC. 

waterfall cann be used in small and short term project like mobile app, 
while agile is suitable in big project and long term project.#


#Requirements Engineering:
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

is the first stage on SDLC that deals with gathering infomation from the customer in designing a software product.
most project manager will ask customer what kind of product he/she want and how it must look.
IMPORTANCE
1. help in designing a software that meet customer need and standard.
2. help in knowing what kind of time is going to be used in given product.
3. help in knowing what kind of ways and tools are going to be used while designing a software.#


#Software Design Principles:
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

modulality in software desing is a design principle that deals with breakdown of system software in smaller
managable , maintained component called modules. these modules are bieng used to perfom various task.
like login, sign up, view document and download.#


Testing in Software Engineering:
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

UNIT testing, these is best for testing modules code inside a software product if they are doing what they are supposed to do.
INTEGRATION testing, these is done to make sure each moduls are having connection and communicate without any error.
SYSTEM testing, these is done to over all product to make sure its done what is supposed to to do, and not otherwise.
ACCEPATANCE testing, these is done to make sure it meet requirement of the user, checking UI and UX.
IMPORTANCE
1. testing help the team to chake the work they have done.
2. checking intergrit of the product
3. to check if they meet user requirement
3. to identify error in their product
4. to check quality of the product
5. to check if there is something they can improve


#Version Control Systems:
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

these are platform used by team in software development to write they code in collaboration, work as the team and check the 
flow of their product.
IMPORTANCE
1. work in collaboration
2. help in debugging the product their producing
3. most version control system are open source means other people can help looking to find bugs in your code or product and help to solve them
4. help to make clarification to user around the word. that the product they are using use the same code as one on version control system.
EXAMPLE:  Git and azure devops server#


#Software Project Management:
Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?

these is last stage on SDLC that deals on keeping track of software product after giving it to the customer to be used by the user.
UPGRADING, making improvement of the software product to meet new requiremnt on UX and UI in differrent hardwre product
DEBUGGING(corrective maintencance), solving different error found on the product after user stating using.
UPDATING (Perfective Maintenance). these is done to add new feature to the software product
SECURITY, to chake and insure the software product is protected against different thrate 
TO insure the software is well maintained so that not to face any future thrate.#


#Software Maintenance:
Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

these is the last stage on SDLC that deals on keeping track of software product after giving it to the customer to be used by the user.
UPGRADING, making improvement of the software product to meet new requiremnt on UX and UI in differrent hardwre product
DEBUGGING(corrective maintencance), solving different error found on the product after user stating using.
UPDATING (Perfective Maintenance). these is done to add new feature to the software product
SECURITY, to chake and insure the software product is protected against different thrate 
TO insure the software is well maintained so that not to face any future thrate.#


#Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
PRIVACY: is to make user data are protected and hidden.
RACIAL DISCRIMINATION in software algorithm, to make the product that you make doed discrimanate against different race, example like waht happen on early 2024. 
        GOOGLE AI(GEMIN), was not able to create picture of people after creating america founders black.
COPY RIGHT, to make sure not to use someone else work, or code.
BALANCING the interest of stakeholders, ie client, user and team in making software product.
TRANSPARENCY, in our work, help user to see the product they are using is the same as the source code.(purpose of version control system)

THINGS TO DO TO FOLLOW ETHICAL STANDRD.
1. is to follow ethical code of ethic made by ACM AND IEEE
2. get ethical training
3. geting feedback from different ethical expert
4. follow a framework for ethical decision making
5. seeking guidance when needed and follow ethical Considerations in their work

NB, I USE OPERA AI (ARIA) TO GET EXPLANATION ON WHAT I WANTED TO EXPLAIN.
